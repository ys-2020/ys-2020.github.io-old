Hi! I am Shang Yang, a fourth-year undergraduate from [Department of Electronic Engineering](https://www.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), Tsinghua University, China. I am interested in building efficient systems for machine learning, aiming to optimize ML frameworks in terms of performance and memory consumption, especially through leveraging the sparsity introduced by the input data and pruning, etc.
